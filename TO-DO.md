TO-DO List

BACKEND
- Resist the temptation to expand to films, documentaries, music, etc.
  - Expand the app using Book only
  - Watch SpringBoot tutorials
  - Move to mySQL?
  - Front-end?
- Look through CS489 notes for project planning/tips
  - Add these to your TO-DO list
- Look through SQL notes, see what other changes you can make

FRONT-END
- Deploy your endpoint to NGROK(?), then do the FreeCodeCamp frontend deployment method
  - https://ngrok.com/docs/http/
- In the frontend, move all api calls into an api utility function module
- Start further frontend learning here:

- Add options for you to specify the details of the book you'd like to add
  - ex. ranges for word count, year published
  - Design it like one of those Fifa Database searches (i.e., with searches and filters)
- Add sorting options on the table
- work_name -> work_title
- Pictures


LONG-TERM
- Write Unit and Integration tests
- Configure with some of these: https://github.com/Adam1302/SpringBoot-AML/actions/new
- Accounts (Username and Password) + "My Books" Page
- GitHub action with SonarCloud (extra steps needed for Maven)

VISION
- I'd like this to be the centre for discussions and resources on Art, Media, Literature
  - Experts can write about topics, host discussions, etc.
    - Currently most "discussions" are scarce and out of sight, with many brilliant minds in low places, speaking to small audiences. This site can change that.
    - ex. Michael Sugrue Plato discussions
- Scheduled discussions, forums, pages for each work
